*Note: AI was used within this project as a tool to aid in test generation & database integration. Commands such as:*
* "write an nbi test suite for a c++ jwks server with a way to show test coverage percent (no google)", and
* "modify this code to write any generated keys to a sqlite3 db file with the schema [\*schema*\]" 

*were given to enhance the scope and correctness of the overall project. Generated code was modified as needed to ensure functionality.*
